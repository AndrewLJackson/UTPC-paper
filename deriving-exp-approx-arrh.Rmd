Define symbols

| Symbol | Explanation |
| ------ | ----------- |
| $y$ | metabolic rate |
| $T$ | Temperature in Kelvin |
| $T_0$ | Kelvin equivalent of $0 ^\circ \text{C} $|
| $T^\circ$ | Temprature in C |
| $E_a$ | Activation energy in $eV$ |
| $k$ | Boltzmann's constant $\approx 8.6 \times 10^{-5}$  in eV/K |
| $A$ | Scaling coefficient |

The Arrhenius equation is defined as

$$y = A e^{-\frac{E_a}{kT}}$$
Some re-writing noting that $T = T_0 + T^\circ$ yields

$$y = Ae^{-\frac{E_a}{kT}} = Ae^{-\frac{E_a}{k}\frac{1}{T}} = Ae^{-(\frac{E_a}{k})(\frac{1}{T_0 + T^\circ})}$$
we want to take advantage of the fact that by Taylor expansion

$$\frac{T_0}{T_0 + T^\circ} \approx 1 - \frac{T^\circ}{T_0}$$
and so we write

$$y = Ae^{-(\frac{E_a}{k})(\frac{1}{T_0})(\frac{T_0}{T_0 + T^\circ})}$$
meaning we can approximate as

$$y = Ae^{-(\frac{E_a}{k})(\frac{1}{T_0})(1 - \frac{T^\circ}{T_0})}$$
we then define

$$\epsilon = \frac{kT_0}{E_a}$$
and our rescaled dimensionless temperature

$$\tau = \frac{T^\circ}{T_0}$$
so that we can write 

$$y = A e^{-(\frac{1}{\epsilon})(1 - \tau)} = A e^{(\frac{\tau - 1}{\epsilon})}$$
since the $-1$ in the numerator acts a left shift in the exponential is this sufficient to yield

$$Arr(T) \propto e^{\tau/k}$$
